# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
I am an extremely passionate person for programming and anything I set my mind to. I do have autism, however I don't let this define me, and continue to push through with everything that I work on, making sure I go above and beyond and come out the other end with something I am proud of. When working on team projects, I am an excellent communicator, as I update my team with progress and tend to take on the role of the leader, making sure that everyone is on the same page and producing something they are comfortable completing.
